# Bootstrapper, or spawning cytomine with docker-compose

A tool for deploying Cytomine with Docker Compose on one or more servers.

It should support:
- the most simple and self-contained initial configuration for a cytomine instance: `cytomine.yml`, one `docker compose.yml` file per target server and optional configuration files
- zero or minimal duplication of environment variables definition (e.g. urls, path, etc)
- a straightforward and simple way of converting the initial configuration files into deployment-ready files
- Cytomine services deployment on each target server with a simple `docker compose up` command (using the deployment files)

It should not support:
- automatic generation of Docker Compose files

Additional goals:
- deprecate `Cytomine-bootstrap` and `Cytomine-bootstrap-generator`

# Inputs

The inputs are the following:

- a `./cytomine.yml` file: environment variables and configurations files
- one folder `./{SERVER-IDENTIFIER}` per target server where `SERVER-IDENTIFIER` is a string identifier for the server (e.g. server name). Each folder contains:
  - a classical `docker-compose.yml` file defining what and how services should run on this server
  - an optional subfolder containing groups of configuration files to mount at deployment: `./{SERVER-IDENTIFIER}/configs/{CONFIG-GROUP}/{CONFIG-FILE}`. A config group contains a set of files that should all be mounted on the same 

In the case of a single-server install, the bootstrapper supports a simplified folder hierarchy can where the server folder can be omitted: the `docker-compose.yml` file and `configs` folder can be located at the same level as the `cytomine.yml` file. 

## Compose files `docker-compose.yml`

Each docker-compose file defines what services should run on a specific server. All dockerfiles may use environment variables to be interpolated when `docker compose up` is called. These variables are defined in the `global` section of the `cytomine.yml` file (see next section).

Configuration files present in a server folder must be mounted relatively to the path of the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## A environment configuration file: `cytomine.yml`

This files condenses the definition of environment variables necessary to deploy the cytomine instance in a declarative way. 

The hierarchy in `cytomine.yml` is the following: `(global|per-service).{namespace}.{value-type}.{env-var-name}.{value}`:

The top-level sections:

- `global`: for defining global variables that can be referred to later in the `cytomine.yml` `per-service` section (see below) and in the `docker-compose.yml` file(s). These variables will only be used by the bootstrapper and will not be seen by the container unless specified.
- `per-service`: defines which environment variables will be attached to the containers

The subsections:

- `namespace`: a namespace for environment variables (to keep them well organized and avoid unnecessary prefixing) 
- `value-type`: how the bootstrapper should interpret the specified `value` field to assign the value to the environment variable. Three possible types:
    - `constant`: read `value` as it is parsed by the YAML parser (`value` should be a primitive type) 
    - `auto`: the value is auto-generated by a method specified by `value` when the bootstrapper is executed
    - `global` (not supported in `envs.global` section): value extracted from a variable defined in the `global` subsection (`value` should be `{namespace}.{env-var-name}`) 
- `env-var-name`: case-sensitive name of the environment variable
- `value`: the value to interpret based on `value-type`

The per-service namespace should match `{SERVICE}-{SERVER-IDENTIFIER}` where `SERVICE` is the name of the service in the docker compose file and `SERVER-IDENTIFIER` is the name of the identifier of the server (the same as for the corresponding server folder). In the case of single-server install this latter term can be omitted and the namespace can just be: `{SERVICE}`. 

The `global` variables can be referred to in the docker compose files following the following naming convention: `${NAMESPACE}_{ENV-VAR-NAME}` or `${{{NAMESPACE}_{ENV-VAR-NAME}}}` (eg. `$IMGS_CORE` or `${IMGS_CORE}` if namespace is `imgs` and var name is `CORE`). Dashes/hyphens in namespaces will be converted into underscores in environment variables names.

### Automatic env generation
This section documents the accepted values for the `value-type` `'auto'`:

- plain strings (e.g. `random-uuid`) in which case this string denotes a parameter-free generation method (or a method where all parameters have default values)
- key-value list where one of the keys must be `type` and contain an identifier of the generation method. Other key-value pairs contain the parameter names and values required by the generation method. 

A parameter-free generation method can also be declared as key-value list in which case only the `type` entry must be specified. Supported generation types in the following subsections.

The key-value list can also accept additional parameters:

- `freeze`, boolean, default `true`: whether or not to move this parameter and its generated value to the `constant` section of the new `cytomine.yml` file generated by the bootstrapper. If set to `false`, the generated value will only be set in the `.env` files and will remain in the `auto` section with the same `value`. 


#### Random UUID

Type: `random-uuid`, parameter-free

Generates a random UUID such as `801acff7-ccc5-48b3-bf9f-52f55e530f88`.

#### Random OpenSSL string

Type: `openssl`

Generates a random string using `openssl`.

Parameters:
- (optional) `base64`, boolean, default `true`: whether or not encode the generated string in base 64
- (optional) `length`, int, default `0`: the length of the final string    

# Bootstrapping and outputs

Before a docker-compose can be up'ed, the bootstrapper must read the `cytomine.yml` and generate deployment files.

This can be done by mounting the directory containing the inputs files (`cytomine.yml`, etc.) to a bootstrapper container as a `/bootstrap` folder and launching it:

```
docker run -v $(pwd):/bootstrap --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" --rm --it BOOTSTRAPPER_IMAGE [... PARAMS]
```

This will generate a deployment folder in `/bootstrap/{FOLDER}` containing all files necessary for running the container (`FOLDER` can either be autogenerated or specified in the parameters of the boostrapper). By default, this folder contains:

- `cytomine.yml`: a clone of the initial cytomine.yml file where auto-generated variables have been optionally moved to the constant sections. This file can be used for future configuration change.
- a subfolder `{SERVER-IDENTIFIER}` for each target server containing:
  - `{SERVER-IDENTIFIER}/.env`: defines the environment variables to be interpolated in the docker-compose.yml file
  - `{SERVER-IDENTIFIER}/docker-compose.yml`: an unmodified clone of the initial `docker-compose.yml` file 
  - `{SERVER-IDENTIFIER}/docker-compose.override.yml`: an override Docker Compose file to attach environment variables (using files in `{SERVER-IDENTIFIER}/envs`) and mounting configuration files to each service
  - `{SERVER-IDENTIFIER}/envs/{SERVICE}.env`: .env files containing environment variables defined for the given service running on this server
  - `{SERVER-IDENTIFIER}/configs/{SERVICE}/{CONFIG-GROUP}/{CONFIG-FILE}`: configuration files organized by service and config groups.
